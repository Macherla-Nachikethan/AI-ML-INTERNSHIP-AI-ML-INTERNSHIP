Task 1: Data Cleaning &amp; Preprocessing
Objective: Learn how to clean and prepare raw data for ML.
Hints/Mini Guide:
   1. Import the dataset and explore basic info (nulls, data types).
   2 . Handle missing values using mean/median/imputation.
   3. Convert categorical features into numerical using encoding.
   4.Normalize/standardize the numerical features.
   5. Visualize outliers using boxplots and remove them.

What You'll Learn: Data cleaning, handling nulls, encoding, feature scaling.

Handle missing values using mean/median/imputation makes me feel hard, so I researched and made it by using Google and YouTube tutorials
